# Rocking Secrets

You probably thought this was going to be the last of the posts that I make on these mysterious pages.

When I was in the orphanage, I was exposed to conditions that made it difficult for me to cope with the lack of having any support, care, or attention. I was in a crib isolated and I was sometimes wearing the same diaper for a week at a time. In the orphanage, we all learned that rocking our bodies back and forth made the sensation of touch keep us alive. We were moving our bodies back and forth in a rythm that kept us alive. 

It's as simple as that. 

I've rocked by head since I was a little newborn infant in the orphanage when I was deposited after I was stolen under Decree 770. The failures of my own mother to get my sister and myself from the orphanage, was a horrible crime against the both of us after Ceaușescu was eliminated and we were free from what he was doing to us. 

When I came to America, I continued rocking. I stopped when I turned 17. When I became a father, and I heard the baby's cry for Mama's milk, I resumed rocking.

The adult male neck is not made to rock like that. 

Rock and roll, yes, but not that kind of rocking.

It's a rocking secret that has me in pain that resulted in discrimination and unlawful termination from Beamable as a consequence of having this condition. 

My manager knew about the orphanage. I told him before I started working for him. 

He knew that I am a survivor and that I am who I am. 

And he continued to ignore my cries for relief for 113 days when I was rocking my head back and forth so quickly in reaction to endless alarms that were going off in the middle of the night. 

I want to see Ali and the rest of Beamable on the stand for what they did to me and I want the US Federal Government enforce EEOC and Americans with Disabilities rights. 

I wouldn't want to be accused of wishing them to spend a day in the orphanage that made me rock my head. 

But when I say to you that I cannot do something, and what would happen was incideous and needs to be called out. 

Who is willing to offer to find out what happened?

I went from being a big figure online to making video games for the world during the pause and now here I am and Director Who has been out for a year now and we're watching the Q stuff come to real life. 

Feels like we live in a simulation.
