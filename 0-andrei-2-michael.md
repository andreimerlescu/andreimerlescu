# Andrei to Michael

This should be the consider of this book, though reading it may not be in order. Time is an illusion. I will try to convey what happened to me as it comes to me and I will update this draft accordingly until I understand what happened to me. 

I demand accountability for what happened to me and I demand the ability to speak to what happened to me. I hate my creator for allowing my family to go on unjudged for what they did to me and I have a heavy cross to carry.
